Create a list containing the names of at least three animals with a common characteristic.
Use a for loop to print out the name of each animal.
Modify the program to print a statement about each animal, such as "A dog would make a great pet."
Finally, add a line at the end stating what these animals have in common, such as "Any of these animals would make a great pet!"
