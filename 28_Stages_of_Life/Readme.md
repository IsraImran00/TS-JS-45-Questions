If age is at least 2 but less than 4, print 'Person is a toddler'.
If age is at least 4 but less than 13, print 'Person is a kid'.
If age is at least 13 but less than 20, print 'Person is a teenager'.
If age is at least 20 but less than 65, print 'Person is an adult'.
If age is 65 or older, print 'Person is an elder'.
